  "current_round": 4,
  "discussion_history": [
    "Round 1 - Proposal Coordinator: The proposal lacks a detailed outline of how the success metrics will be measured and verified, particularly for user satisfaction and API cost reduction. Additionally, it would be beneficial to clarify the criteria for \"actively used\" to ensure consistent reporting standards across teams.",
    "Round 1 - Financial Controller: The proposal does not address the potential financial implications of ongoing support costs after the initial three-month period, especially for post-deployment maintenance and support. Additionally, the 10% API cost reduction as a success metric may need further validation methods to ensure accountability in reporting.",
    "Round 1 - Technical Advisor: The proposal does not specify the technology stack for the dashboard, which could impact the implementation feasibility based on integration with existing systems. Furthermore, the reliance on a single team member poses a significant risk; knowledge gaps or personnel changes could jeopardize both development and ongoing support efforts.",
    "Round 1 - Chief Auditor: The proposal lacks a detailed risk assessment regarding compliance with existing regulations, particularly in terms of data privacy and user consent, which could pose potential legal risks. Additionally, the absence of a contingency plan for technical skill transfer or backup resources in case of the sole team member's unavailability raises further operational concerns.",
    "Round 2 - Proposal Coordinator: The proposal does not outline how training program effectiveness will be measured beyond user satisfaction, which is critical for assessing the overall success of the implementation. Additionally, clarification on the criteria for defining \"success\" in terms of \"automated system health checks\" could enhance the reliability of the monitoring strategy post-deployment.",
    "Round 2 - Financial Controller: The proposal lacks a clear breakdown of anticipated ongoing costs for support and maintenance after the initial three months, which could create unplanned financial pressures. Additionally, it would be prudent to assess the financial implications of any potential software updates or changes required to maintain compliance with evolving data privacy regulations post-implementation.",
    "Round 2 - Technical Advisor: The proposal does not address potential dependencies on third-party libraries and services that could introduce risks related to vendor lock-in or changes in APIs that may impact the dashboard's functionality. Additionally, there should be a clearer plan for scalability, particularly if usage expands beyond the initial teams, as this could affect the system's performance and resource allocation.",
    "Round 2 - Chief Auditor: The proposal should include a contingency plan for maintaining compliance with evolving regulations, as the established practices may not suffice in the longer term. Additionally, the absence of a defined protocol for knowledge transfer beyond the primary team member raises concerns about the continuity of support and development if that individual is unavailable.",
    "Round 3 - Proposal Coordinator: The proposal lacks a comprehensive outline for knowledge transfer strategies, which could ensure continuity of support and development beyond the sole team member. Additionally, a clearer plan for addressing potential software updates and compliance changes post-deployment is essential for addressing ongoing regulatory responsibilities.",
    "Round 3 - Financial Controller: The proposal does not sufficiently address the financial impacts of potential scope changes during the project's implementation that could lead to increased costs. Furthermore, a detailed forecast of how ongoing necessary adjustments to system monitoring or compliance measures might affect the budget in the long term is necessary to manage financial risks effectively.",
    "Round 3 - Technical Advisor: The proposal should incorporate a more explicit strategy for ensuring ongoing knowledge retention and transfer within the team to mitigate risks related to the reliance on a single team member. Additionally, there is a need to evaluate the long-term sustainability of the chosen monitoring libraries and cloud-native solutions to prevent issues arising from lack of support or community engagement for those tools in the future.",
    "Round 3 - Chief Auditor: The proposal should detail a plan for the transition of responsibilities and ensure that knowledge retention protocols are integrated into the training program to avoid knowledge silos. Additionally, a framework for assessing how software updates might impact compliance requirements should be established, with provisions for responding to regulatory changes."
