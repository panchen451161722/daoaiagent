        "Technical Advisor: The proposal seems technically feasible due to its reliance on established open-source libraries, a clear phased implementation plan, and strong risk mitigation strategies for both technical and compliance aspects. However, a concern arises regarding the scalability of the single team member to handle evolving requirements and support post-deployment, which may affect the training and user adoption metrics. It is crucial to ensure adequate resources and potential scalability in team size to maintain alignment with the DAO's emphasis on collaborative success and user satisfaction."
