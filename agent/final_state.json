        "Round 1 - Proposal Coordinator: The proposal aligns with the DAO's objective of advancing blockchain technology through innovative projects, particularly in the area of analytics and security. However, further clarification on how the dashboard's analytics will contribute to blockchain research or innovation would enhance alignment with the DAO's value of innovation focus. Additionally, ensuring the training materials are open-source and widely accessible would reinforce the values of open-source collaboration and academic excellence.",
        "Round 1 - Financial Controller: The proposal does a commendable job in addressing various risks and ensuring compliance; however, further details on how the dashboard's analytics will feed back into research initiatives or drive academic collaborations would strengthen its alignment with the DAO's objectives. Furthermore, ensuring that all training materials are not only open-source but also under licenses that promote collaborative improvements would enhance adherence to the values of scientific rigor and open-source collaboration.",
        "Round 1 - Technical Advisor: The proposal lacks details on how the usage analytics will not only support LLM optimization but also foster collaboration or lead to new insights in blockchain technology specifically, which could further enhance its alignment with the DAO's objectives. Additionally, it would be beneficial to specify the open-source licenses for the training materials to ensure they promote collaborative contributions and innovations, reinforcing the DAO's values of scientific rigor and open-source collaboration.",
        "Round 1 - Chief Auditor: The proposal should explicitly illustrate how the analytics generated from the dashboard will directly support ongoing research projects or lead to specific insights that can advance blockchain technology, as this would strengthen its alignment with the DAO's objectives. Additionally, outlining specific open-source licenses for training materials would ensure they remain accessible and encourage collaborative enhancements, reinforcing the DAO's values of scientific rigor and open-source collaboration.",
        "Round 2 - Financial Controller: The proposal should incorporate a clear outline of how the analytics from the dashboard will directly influence ongoing research initiatives or contribute to new blockchain advancements, ensuring alignment with the DAO's core objectives. Additionally, specifying the open-source licenses for the training materials is crucial to facilitate collaborative improvements and uphold the values of scientific rigor and open-source collaboration.",
        "Round 2 - Technical Advisor: The proposal should also address how the data collected through the dashboard can be used to create benchmarks or best practices for other blockchain projects, enhancing the potential for academic collaborations and innovative research outputs. This could further solidify its alignment with the DAO's objectives. Additionally, outlining mechanisms for feedback from users on how the dashboard impacts their projects could support a culture of continuous improvement and innovation, aligning with the DAO's values.",
        "Round 2 - Chief Auditor: The proposal could benefit from a more explicit plan on how the dashboard's analytics will be used to develop benchmarks or best practices that drive academic collaborations in blockchain technology, further solidifying its alignment with the DAO's objectives. Additionally, incorporating an explicit feedback loop mechanism from users regarding their experiences and outcomes from using the dashboard would enhance continuous improvement and innovation, aligning with the DAO's values.",
        "Round 3 - Proposal Coordinator: The proposal should clarify how the insights gained from the dashboard will lead to specific research advancements or innovations in blockchain technology. Additionally, explicitly detailing the approach for integrating user feedback into subsequent iterations of the dashboard could further promote a culture of continuous improvement, aligning with the DAO's values of innovation focus and research reproducibility.",
        "Round 3 - Financial Controller: The proposal must ensure that the insights generated from the dashboard not only contribute to research advancements but also highlight their impact on collaborative initiatives within the blockchain space. Additionally, a structured process for incorporating user feedback into future dashboard iterations should be outlined to enhance adaptive improvements, fostering a culture of innovation and reproducibility as per the DAO's values.",
        "Round 3 - Technical Advisor: The proposal should include mechanisms to specifically document how insights from the dashboard will be systematically recorded and disseminated to support public academic collaborations or publications, enhancing reproducibility and transparency in research efforts. Furthermore, establishing a framework for continuous user engagement beyond initial training sessions can foster ongoing updates and improvements based on real-world usage, aligning with the DAO's values of research reproducibility and innovation focus.",
        "Round 3 - Chief Auditor: The proposal needs to address how the insights generated will be effectively communicated to the broader blockchain research community, possibly through publications or collaborative platforms, to ensure compliance with the DAO's objective of promoting academic collaboration. Additionally, a clear strategy for ongoing user engagement that maintains momentum for improvements and updates post-deployment could further strengthen its alignment with the values of innovation focus and research reproducibility."
