        "Technical Advisor: The proposal provides a comprehensive structure for the implementation of a secure LLM analytics dashboard, aligning well with the DAO's objective of advancing blockchain research through solid infrastructure. A new concern arises around the scalability of the dashboard post-MVP; ensuring that the architecture can accommodate increased usage and feature expansion will be vital for long-term success and adherence to research reproducibility. Additionally, the sustainability of the training and support infrastructure beyond the initial three-month period needs to be addressed to maintain academic excellence and continual user engagement."
