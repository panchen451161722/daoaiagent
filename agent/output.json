    "Technical Advisor: The proposal for the LLM Analytics Dashboard aligns with the DAO’s objective of advancing blockchain technology by supporting innovative research initiatives. However, consideration should be given to the potential need for collaborative input from experts to ensure the dashboard's security and maintainability, which reflects the DAO's commitment to academic excellence and open-source collaboration. Moreover, the single-person team may pose risks in meeting the timeline effectively, suggesting a need for additional resources or support.",
    "Financial Advisor: The proposed budget of $52,000 for the LLM Analytics Dashboard is a reasonable investment, but the reliance on a single team member raises concerns regarding capacity, which could jeopardize both the timeline and quality of outcomes. To enhance the proposal's success and align with the DAO’s values of innovation focus and academic excellence, it’s advisable to allocate additional resources or include collaborative partnerships with experts in security and development to ensure a robust and maintainable product.",
    "Compliance Officer: The proposal for the LLM Analytics Dashboard shows promise in advancing blockchain technology and aligns with the DAO's values. However, a single team member may lead to operational risks; therefore, I recommend increasing the team size or establishing collaborative partnerships to enhance capacity and ensure the project meets the standards of scientific rigor and innovation focus. This ensures a more robust development process and adherence to the DAO's commitment to research reproducibility."
